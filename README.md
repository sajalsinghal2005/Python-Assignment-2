# Python Assignment 2

## Module 3: Control Structures in Python

This repository contains two Python programs based on control structures:

### Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
- The program takes an integer input from the user.
- It checks whether the number is even or odd using an **if-else statement**.
- It then displays the result to the user.

### Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop
- The program uses a **for loop** to iterate from 1 to 50.
- It calculates the sum of all integers in this range.
- Finally, it displays the total sum.
